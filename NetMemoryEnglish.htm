Run it as an Administrator.. otherwise the Connection will fail. Net Memory .NET English is no longer available. This one is uses the Dutch language.
       <BR>
            <h2 id="Description">Description:</h2>
            There may be some MODEM settings necessary, for portforwarding on a free port, e.g. 1200 for the IPV4 addresses. See also for KPN users the document : 'opmerkingen voor KPN gebruikers', in dutch.<br>
       When making the Connection together, with 2 programs of the samen given Software title keep remembering you have to make that Connection quickly because after Clicking Connect there is a time out interval of 30 seconds waiting for the other to respond. <br>
       While you doing this communicate over telephone, smartphone e.g. Whatsapp (voice) about it for a timed Connection within the 30 seconds interval.
        One can choose from animals, birds, flowers, alphabet, greek alphabet and numbers with different number of cards all integrated in 1 executable.
        Rightclick the Net Memory .NET icon in windows searchwindow result after lookup and select: Run as administrator, to be able to save the 'Hall Of Fame' data of (solo ?) games that were finished, Replay games and to Connect to your opponent !
        <br />Remark: Use the 'Send' option in the menu 'Play', in case of a card is staying on the screen or when the program doesn't seem to be responding any longer.., while the connection maybe alive !!
        <br />If this somehow doesn't resolve your problem, try to RESTORE the remainder of the game with the 'Send' option in the menu 'Play' from the other side of the connection and try to continue the game then.
        The score should then be resend also.. Good Luck, some times flipping a card results in a hang and the program fails to continue.
        Likewise a UDP Protocol and TCP/IP connection seems not always 100 percent reliable on the WAN internet. It is dependent by Network traffic and possible congestion ! And when a Router, Bridge or Switch contains your packets imagine what happened if there were an outburst, a Power dip, a Power off, Shutdown, short circuit, fire or nature disaster etc. ! But in most cases this is unlikely to happen a lot. Use it on your own risks.<br>
        Your own local IP-address:<br> you will find it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD or the command-prompt for connecting in a LAN.
        <BR></BR>
        

        Playing in a LAN (Local Area Network) or direct via an UTP-cable works somewhat different from <u>playing on the WAN, internet:</u><BR>
        The IP-address to connect, you fill this in: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the command-prompt. You can type CMD in
        the search field on Windows 10 on your taskbar.
        In CMD look carefully for 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi' if your connected via Wi-Fi.
        <p></p>
        The IP-address from your opponent on the WAN: you will have to get it via WhatsApp e.g. from him/her.
        He/she can get it from https://whatismyipaddress.com/ in the link below.
        : you have to send it to your opponent via WhatsApp of phone.
        
    <LI>
        <A HREF="https://whatismyipaddress.com/
">Get to know your IP-address for the outside world </A>: send this via WhatsApp so your opponent can fill it in for Net Memory.NET (remote IP-address), keep the line open during game play.
        Also you may want to configure your MODEM for port-forwarding on e.g. port 1200, normally a free port (e.g. look under NAT, Network Address Translation)

                          The first requirement is that two computers, with two instances of the software, have an internet connection.  When you are Player #1, for example, on your computer, WIFI is on.<br>
                          There are multiple configurations possible like a multiplayer (2 players) game or Solo, but a 2 Players game via a Network is my favourite !
   <p>
                        <h2 id="Case1">Case #1</h2> [Connect]-ing two computers <u>in a (Wireless) home network situation</u> using KPN Modem Sagemcom box B12<br>
            <p></p>
             First you may want to know, when a connection is established between two instances of such a Memory Game X. You can touch, or click with your mouse, let's say 'teleport' a game like this, in the following way: <br>
              
             Player #1 turns on UPnP IGD in the KPN Sagemcom Experia box B12 Modem/Router, if necessary ? No, in most cases the UPnP IGD setting will have to be turned off for security reasons. <br>   
                Make a rule for a Memory Game x game or a Net Four In A Row version in the Modem and make sure it is turned on.<br>
                Save the just made changes.<br>
                       Let's say: you are Player #1, your opponent Player #2.<br>
                       Then Player #1 is searching the host address of his or her computer for filling in the internal host in the Modem, with CMD.EXE (search field on your taskbar) & ipconfig.<br>
   
                       In a field 'external host' of the Modem of Player #1, with Port forwarding, the IPV4 item should be recognized by an asterisk typographical symbol or glyph: (*).<br>
                       Player #1 is searching the external host address then, this will Player #2 fill in in the inputfield of his or her or program later.<br>
                       Then if the data in the Modem was saved, Player #2 touches or presses or clicks, with his or her mousepointer [Listen].<br>
                       Player #1 is typing in his or her inputfield  the host address of computer 2 of Player #2. This address of his or her computer he/she should remembering from a note or by head, can be found in the Modem. (It is one from the private network addresses in the 192.168.xxx.xxx range, like for example 192.168.2.7 in my case)<br>
                       Player #2 is typing in the inputfield of the program on computer 2, the external host IP address.<br>
                       Once [Enter] is touched or pressed with the mousepointer, Player #1 is counting 3..2..1.. & Player #1 touches or clicks with the mousepointer [Connect], after this 1 of 2 sec. approximately later. Player #2 should do the same. Mind the order of actions described, VPN off for both and the last clicking of [Enter] within the 30 seconds time out ? You did it.<br>
                       Result: Test Succeeded ! Connection established.<br>
                       Now you just have to Start a New game (menu spelen) or Send the Game Play data in the Memory Games, Full screen and start Playing the Game.<br>
                       
                            <br>

  'Player #1', I ,also look up my external host IP address, in the usual way via a website or the Modem. <br>
  'Player #1' notes the external host IP Address of 'Player #2', which he or she receives via Whatsapp or phone from 'Player #2' & 'Player #2' notes that of 'Player #1', for later use. <br>
  Both 'Players' press or click, with their mouse pointer, then on [Listen], while Whatsapp or phone line is open in a situation over the internet. <br>
  Both 'Players' enter the external IP addresses, which they have previously obtained e.g. by telephone from their 'opponent', in the input field as an end point or end device address. <br>
  Both 'Players' press [Enter] shortly after each other (the Whatsapp or telephone line remains open for verification later, in a situation over the internet)<br>
  'Player #1' counts 3..2..1.. if he or she has pressed or clicked [Connect] with his or her mouse pointer. <br>
  'Player #2' also presses or clicks [Connect] (with his/her mouse pointer) shortly afterwards, e.g. 1 to 2 seconds later. <br>
  'Player #2' plays and Player #1 also plays.. <br>
                 
  Result: test passed! Connection accomplished. <br><br>
  Good luck!
  NB: this test case was done by connecting two devices of my own and then 'supposedly' playing.. (with myself as a test). But a whole Game Play according to this manual should be successful also.

        Tips: -Type ipconfig at the command prompt to discover your ip4 address to use with one of the games.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      - all games: Make sure your font size is set to default 96 DPI when used in Windows Vista : this can be achieved; type font in control panel..
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: Don't forget to make first a Connect(ion) then Start !
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: Don't play too fast, keep e.g. a time interval of approx one second between mouseclicks
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: You can really play it via internet and also by connecting a standard network cable (UTP) between 2 PC's or over a LAN with e.g. a friend.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: If you play with two people use the same programming language version of the program (Delphi or 'Qt & C++' or 'Unity & C#' programmed). This is the only way the two instances or programs can communicate properly !
