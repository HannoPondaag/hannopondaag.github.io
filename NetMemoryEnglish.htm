Run it as an Administrator.. otherwise the Connection will fail. Net Memory .NET English is no longer available. This one is uses the Dutch language.
       <BR>
            <h2 id="Description">Description:</h2>
            There may be some MODEM settings necessary, for portforwarding on a free port, e.g. range 1200-1200 for the IPV4 addresses. See also for KPN users the document : 'opmerkingen voor KPN gebruikers', in dutch.<br>
       When making the Connection together, with 2 programs of the samen given Software title keep remembering you have to make that Connection quickly because after Clicking Connect there is a time out interval of 30 seconds waiting for the other to respond. <br>
       While you doing this communicate over telephone, smartphone e.g. Whatsapp (voice) about it for a timed Connection within the 30 seconds interval.
        One can choose from animals, birds, flowers, alphabet, greek alphabet and numbers with different number of cards all integrated in 1 Microsoft Store App.
        Rightclick the Net Memory .NET icon in windows searchwindow result after lookup and select: Run as administrator, to be able to save the 'Hall Of Fame' data of (solo ?) games that were finished, to Replay games and to Connect to your opponent !
        <br />Remark: Use the 'Send' option in the menu 'Play', in case of a card is staying on the screen or when the program doesn't seem to be responding any longer.., while the connection maybe alive !!
        <br />If this somehow doesn't resolve your problem, try to RESTORE the remainder of the game with the 'Send' option in the menu 'Play' from the other side of the connection and try to continue the game then.
        The score should then be resend also.. Good Luck, some times flipping a card results in a hang and the program fails to continue.
        Likewise a UDP Protocol and TCP/IP connection seems not always 100 percent reliable on the WAN internet. It is dependent by Network traffic and possible congestion ! And when a Router, Bridge or Switch contains your packets imagine what happened if there were an outburst, a Power dip, a Power off, Shutdown, short circuit, fire or nature disaster etc. ! But in most cases this is unlikely to happen a lot. Use it on your own risks.<br>
        Your own local IPv4-address:<br> you will find it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD or the command-prompt for connecting in a LAN.
        <BR></BR>
        

        Playing in a LAN (Local Area Network) or direct via an UTP-cable works somewhat different from <u>playing on the WAN, internet:</u><BR>
        The IPv4-address to connect, you fill this in: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the command-prompt. You can type CMD in
        the search field on Windows 10 on your taskbar.
        In CMD look carefully for 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi' if your connected via Wi-Fi.
        <p></p>
        The IPv4-address from your opponent on the WAN: you will have to get it via WhatsApp e.g. from him/her.
        He/she can get it from https://whatismyipaddress.com/ in the link below.
        : you have to send it to your opponent via WhatsApp of phone.
        
    <LI>
        <A HREF="https://whatismyipaddress.com/
">Get to know your IPv4-address for the outside world </A>: send this via WhatsApp so your opponent can fill it in for Net Memory.NET (remote IP-address), keep the line open during game play.
        Also you may want to configure your MODEM for port-forwarding on e.g. port 1200, normally a free port (e.g. look under NAT, Network Address Translation)
This method also requires a MODEM setting (port forwarding on port 1200-1201, on the range 1200 to 1201 or even higher, e.g. 1200-1202 is sufficient for the certainty of the port numbers, in connection with port forwarding on your IPv4 address, at home usually an address from the so-called private range). For the vast majority of the population for home use again!, see e.g. for KPN users the document: 'remarks for KPN users' and as described in the manual and test cases below.

                          The first requirement is that two computers, with two instances of the software, have an internet connection.  When you are Player #1, for example, on your computer, WIFI is on.<br>
                          There are multiple configurations possible like a multiplayer (2 players) game or Solo, but a 2 Players game via a Network is my favourite !
   <p>
                        <h2 id="Case1">Case #1</h2> [Connect]-ing two computers <u>in a (Wireless) home network situation</u> using KPN Modem Sagemcom box B12<br>
            <p></p>
             First you may want to know, when a connection is established between two instances of such a Memory Game X. You can touch, or click with your mouse, let's say 'teleport' Game Play clicks like this, in the following manner: <br>
              
             Player #1 turns on UPnP IGD in the KPN Sagemcom Experia box B12 Modem/Router. UPnP IGD must be enabled in the modem settings due to...  the security ?  It is possible for gaming according to the KPN (provider) forum. <br> 
                Make a rule for a Memory Game x game or a Net Four In A Row version in the Modem and make sure it is turned on.<br>
                Save the just made changes.<br>
                       Let's say: you are Player #1, your opponent Player #2.<br>
                       Then Player #1 is searching, using the Command-prompt 'CMD' and ipconfig, the host address of his or her computer 1 for filling in the internal host in the Modem Settings.<br>
   
                       In a field 'external host' of the Modem of Player #1, with Port forwarding, the IPV4 item should be recognized by an asterisk typographical symbol or star-shaped character: '*'.<br>
                       <p></p>
                       Player #1 is searching, using the Command-prompt and ipconfig, the external host address then, this will Player #2 fill in in the inputfield of his or her or program later, see below.<br>
                       Then if the data in the Modem was saved, Player #2 touches or presses or clicks, with his or her mousepointer [Listen].<br>
                       Player #1 is typing in his or her inputfield the host address of computer 2 of Player #2 found by Player #2, which he or her should find, searching with the Command-prompt 'CMD' and ipconfig, this address of his or her computer he/she should remembering from a note or by head, It is one specific IP address from the private network addresses in the 192.168.xxx.xxx range, like for example 192.168.2.7 in my case.<br>
                       Player #2 is, does the same things mirror wise, clicking [Listen] typing in the inputfield of the program on computer 2, the external host IP address already found by player #1.<br>
                       Once [Enter] is touched or pressed with the mousepointer, Player #1 is counting 3..2..1.. & Player #1 touches or clicks with the mousepointer [Connect], after this 1 of 2 sec. approximately later. Player #2 should do the same. Mind the order of actions described, VPN off for both and the last clicking of the [Connect] button below the IP address inputfield within the 30 seconds time out ? You did it.<br>
                       Result: Test Succeeded ! Connection established.<br>
                       Now you just have to Start a New Game one from Memory Game X and don't forget clicking next [Send]. Clicking that button once, will be sending the Game Play data for the Net Memory Game Series Premium program, Memory Game X, one complete (hidden) set of cards from the server side to the client side across the network. Or once the same thing should be applied vice versa, in the opposite direction, on the other system thus.<br> 
   Using Full Screen, with the right resoltion of the screen,  start Playing the Game next !<br>
                       
                            <br>

          ..<br>
          Create a separate rule for a Memory Game x game or a Four-in-a-Row version in the Modem in the manner described in  <a href="#Case1">Case #1</a>. <br>
        
          Create a hotspot on your mobile smartphone over WiFi & connect the computer /tablet of 'Player #2' via the mobile smartphone over WiFi, the smartphone itself serves as a Wifi point (e.g. temporarily during the procedure of building up a connection and while playing later).. <br>        
          Next my 'opponent', 'Player #2' is looking up his/her IP host address op via..<br>
         Automatic [DHCP] was ON. An IP  address from the: Private Network non-overlapping range 192.168.xxx.xxx on his or her device..<br>
          Look into (i) on your hotspot on your computer or tablet. Of you click (i), Network and Internet will appear.
          There you'll find the IP4 Address of your hotspot to your mobile.
  Click (i) --> Network & Internet <br>
(here comes an image of device #2 of 'Player #2' screenshot)..<br>
  'Player #1', I ,also look up my external host IP address, in the usual way via a website or the Modem. <br>
  'Player #1' notes the external host IP Address of 'Player #2', which he or she receives via Whatsapp or phone from 'Player #2' & 'Player #2' notes that of 'Player #1', for later use. <br>
  Both 'Players' press or click, with their mouse pointer, then on [Listen], while Whatsapp or phone line is open in a situation over the internet. <br>
  Both 'Players' enter the external IP addresses, which they have previously obtained e.g. by telephone from their 'opponent', in the input field as an end point or end device address. <br>
  Both 'Players' press [Enter] shortly after each other (the Whatsapp or telephone line remains open for verification later, in a situation over the internet)<br>
  'Player #1' counts 3..2..1.. if he or she has pressed or clicked [Connect] with his or her mouse pointer. <br>
  'Player #2' also presses or clicks [Connect] (with his/her mouse pointer) shortly afterwards, e.g. 1 to 2 seconds later. <br>
  'Player #2' plays and Player #1 also plays.. <br>
                 
  Result: test passed! Connection accomplished. <br><br>
  Good luck!
  NB: this test case was done by connecting two devices of my own and then 'supposedly' playing.. (with myself as a test). But a whole Game Play according to this manual should be successful also.

                 <h2 id="Case5">Case #5</h2> [Connect]-ing two computers...using two 4G hotspots on two mobile smartphones; a private one for my laptop and a work one for my MS Surface tablet computer. It is a bit the same as in <a href="#Case4">Case #4</a> then, <u> First in an at Home Network situation.</u> <br>
                 
                 Remember Memory Game.. Games are Full Screen, so you might want to adjust resolution to: for example 1920 x 1080 on the tablet so there is no overlap of some input field elements with the blue rack. <br>
                WIFI is OFF on my smartphones, mobile data is ON to make an internet Network connection, of course.  <br>
              VPN is OFF on both computers and on my Smartphone(s).
                 WIFI is ON on the computer or tablet of 'Player #1' and opponent; 'Player #2', both seperately connected to the two mobile hotspots. <br>
                 Then use the two IP addresses of the private internet addresses range: 192.168.***.***, which you can find in the CMD Command Prompt on your system, this is so for both Players, for typing in the Net Connect 4 program instances IP Address field elements on the systems. <br>
                 For now let the cursor in the inputfield on both computers just blink On & Off. <br>
                 Press [Listen] on the laptop computer only, for example, so on one side of the connection to be established. Then [Connect], quickly simultaneously with the two (tablet) computers, to then establish the connection between the two programs more or less at the speed of light, or if you like like a battle out of the blue, while a large black 'link' symbol appears on both systems, within a maximum of 30 seconds after each other to the ultimate goal: to establish a stable connection. Simultaneously on both systems, otherwise a time-out is possible. <br>

                WIFI is ON, on  the Windows 10 laptop or MS Surface computer(-tablet) of 'Player #1' at side A of the connection to be made & at side B of the connection to be made WIFI is ON too, on a Windows computer or Windows Surface computer tablet.<br>

        Tips: -Type ipconfig at the command prompt to discover your ip4 address to use with one of the games.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      - all games: Make sure your font size is set to default 96 DPI when used in Windows Vista : this can be achieved; type font in control panel..
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: Don't forget to make first a Connect(ion) then Start !
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: Don't play too fast, keep e.g. a time interval of approx one second between mouseclicks
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: You can really play it via internet and also by connecting a standard network cable (UTP) between 2 PC's or over a LAN with e.g. a friend.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       -- Memory: If you play with two people, both players must use an instance of the same version (made using one of these software technologies, meant in this manual: .NET, Delphi, Qt or Java or C#).., otherwise communication is probably not possible!
