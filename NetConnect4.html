English language used. NB: Each player across the Net should pay for his or her
        own instance of the software. So, there are two instances of the Program needed when playing Online. There is a workaround for this paying-both scheme though, when logging into the same Microsoft account on different devices before playing time starts, for instance when on a network at home, you only have to pay once, unless you have a Promo Code: then you pay nothing at all.<br>
       Or play on 1 PC or MS Surface tablet with 2 Players, a different option.

">Get to know your IP-address for the outside world </A>: send this via WhatsApp so your opponent can fill it in for Net Memory.NET (remote IP-address) or Net Four In A Row program.
        Also you may want to configure your MODEM for port-forwarding on port 1200.

        Your own local IP-address: you will find it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD or the command-prompt for connecting in a LAN.

        Playing in a LAN (Local Area Network) or direct via an UTP-cable works somewhat different from playing on the WAN internet:
        The IP-address to connect, you fill this in: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the command-prompt. You can type CMD in
        the search field on Windows 10 on your taskbar.
        In CMD look carefully for 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi' if your connected via Wi-Fi.
        <p></p>
        The IP-address from your opponent on the WAN: you will have to get it via WhatsApp e.g. from him/her.
        He/she can get it from https://whatismyipaddress.com/
        : you have to send it to your opponent via WhatsApp of phone.
        There may be some MODEM settings necessary, see e.g. for KPN users the document : 'opmerkingen voor KPN gebruikers', in dutch

                          The first requirement is that two computers, with two instances of the software, have an internet connection.  When you are Player #1, for example, on your computer, WIFI is on.<br>
                          There are multiple configurations possible like in a multiplayer (2 players) game !<br>
                       When making the Connection together, with 2 programs of the samen given Software title be aware of the fact you have to make that Connection quickly because after Clicking Connect there is a time out interval of 30 seconds waiting for the other to respond. <br>
                       Then try communicating for this verbally via phone or Whatsapp when doing this for making the Connection timed and right. <br>

            <p></p>
             First you may want to know, when a connection is established between two instances of such a Net Connect 4 Game. You can touch, or click with your mouse, let's say 'teleport' a game like this, in the following way: <br>
              
             Player #1 turns on UPnP IGD in the KPN Sagemcom Experia box B12 Modem/Router, if necessary ? No, in most cases the UPnP IGD setting will have to be turned off for security reasons. <br>   
                Make a rule for a Memory Game x game or a Net Four In A Row version in the Modem and make sure it is turned on.<br>
                Save the just made changes.<br>
                       Let's say: you are Player #1, your opponent Player #2.<br>
                       Then Player #1 is searching the host address of his or her computer for filling in the internal host in the Modem, with CMD.EXE (search field on your taskbar) & ipconfig.<br>
   
                       In a field 'external host' of the Modem of Player #1, with Port forwarding, the IPV4 item should be recognized by an asterisk typographical symbol or glyph: (*).<br>
                       Player #1 is searching the external host address then, this will Player #2 fill in in the inputfield of his or her or program later.<br>
                       Then if the data in the Modem was saved, Player #2 touches or presses or clicks, with his or her mousepointer [Listen].<br>
                       Player #1 is typing in his or her inputfield  the host address of computer 2 of Player #2. This address of his or her computer he/she should remembering from a note or by head, can be found in the Modem. (It is one from the private network addresses in the 192.168.xxx.xxx range, like for example 192.168.2.7 in my case)<br>
                       Player #2 is typing in the inputfield of the program on computer 2, the external host IP address.<br>
                       Once [Enter] is touched or pressed with the mousepointer, Player #1 is counting 3..2..1.. & Player #1 touches or clicks with the mousepointer [Connect], after this 1 of 2 sec. approximately later. Player #2 should do the same. Mind the order of actions described, VPN off for both and the last clicking of [Enter] within the 30 seconds time out ? You did it.<br>
                       Result: Test Succeeded ! Connection established.<br>

          ..<br>
          Create a separate rule for a Memory Game x game or a Four-in-a-Row version in the Modem in the manner described in  <a href="#Case1">Case #1</a>. <br>
        
          Create a hotspot on your mobile smartphone over WiFi & connect the computer /tablet of 'Player #2' via the mobile smartphone over WiFi, the smartphone itself serves as a Wifi point (e.g. temporarily during the procedure of building up a connection and while playing later).. <br>        
          Next my 'opponent', 'Player #2' is looking up his/her IP host address op via..<br>

          Look into (i) on your hotspot on your computer or tablet. Of you click (i), Network and Internet will appear.
          There you'll find the IP4 Address of your hotspot to your mobile.
  Click (i) --> Network & Internet <br>
(here comes an image of device #2 of 'Player #2' screenshot)..<br>
  'Player #1', I ,also look up my external host IP address, in the usual way via a website or the Modem. <br>
  'Player #1' notes the external host IP Address of 'Player #2', which he or she receives via Whatsapp or phone from 'Player #2' & 'Player #2' notes that of 'Player #1', for later use. <br>
  Both 'Players' press or click, with their mouse pointer, then on [Listen], while Whatsapp or phone line is open in a situation over the internet. <br>
  Both 'Players' enter the external IP addresses, which they have previously obtained e.g. by telephone from their 'opponent', in the input field as an end point or end device address. <br>
  Both 'Players' press [Enter] shortly after each other (the Whatsapp or telephone line remains open for verification later, in a situation over the internet)<br>
  'Player #1' counts 3..2..1.. if he or she has pressed or clicked [Connect] with his or her mouse pointer. <br>
  'Player #2' also presses or clicks [Connect] (with his/her mouse pointer) shortly afterwards, e.g. 1 to 2 seconds later. <br>
