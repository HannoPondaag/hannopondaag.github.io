       Sudoku puzzle player/helper program: fill in a sudoku puzzle, play it, save it and load it! 
       Or play one out of 80 puzzles built in ! Four different levels: easy, medium, hard & very hard ! <br>
       
       To deselect a green selected arrow: click on a randomly chosen green spot in the screen area !<br>
       Sudoku Puzzle Player/Toolbox, it will verify sudoku puzzles: Input or bring your own Sudoku puzzles, any of your choice (from Puzzle booklets, newspapers or magazines for instance). Play them, save them and reload & continue them (one at a time) ! With nice Sound Effects. With New neat Lay-out. <br>
                After inputting the numbers of your choice finish the Puzzle you have by confirming your inputs with touching or pressing the [Lock numbers] symbol with your forefinger or mouse.<br>
               Basically the Game tolerates or allows for 2 mistakes a Person to make. Once you make a 3rd Number wrong input; it is Game Over.
               In combination with the Pencil symbol or icon you can make 'little notes' or let's say input the 'little Numbers' as reminders into the square boxes.
                In combination with the black disk symbol you can Save a puzzle before Quitting. With the black 'refresh' symbol you can reload a previously Saved Puzzle from an earlier Run. Reloading, after 'Quitting and saving' are working 'out-of-the-box', there is no such a thing necessary as/ NO 'Run(ning) as Administrator' or something.
                Use the black disk symbol for saving an unfinished puzzle. NB: there is an Autosave functionality in the Program when Closing or Quitting it and optional every minute (if you want to try the new optional Autosave symbols start trying them out by clicking the big green Checkmark symbol to switch Autosave to Off !). <br>
               
                - With 80 Puzzles built in (4 levels: easy, medium, hard & very hard) to load from memory ! <br>
                Do you want the default built in Puzzles ? <br>
                First you select the puzzle number with the arrows in the horizontal aligned direction.  <br>
                Second, with the arrows in the vertical direction aligned, you can Change the level of the Puzzle selected. <br>
                Then in combination with the yellow refresh symbol you can load the resulting selected puzzle (see Status: ..) from memory resources. Press the 'Start button for restarting the workload. <br>
                
                <br>
                Tips or Remarks: - In some cases you might want to adjust your screen resolution according to what best suits you to a mode that fits with everything in the focus of the screen, for instance on a tablet: 1920 x 1080 (example).<br>
                  - For a more pleasurable seamless experience on a tablet: make sure you work with a full battery, unless you are plugged into a wall socket with your device so your tablet stays charged all the time.<br>
                  - solving a Puzzle together with someone (for instance: your Spouse, Partner, Friend or Aquaintance) can perhaps be pleasurable also. 'Who is finishing the Puzzle first..?!'
